# Hi there 👋  

My name is **Aleksandr**, I'm a passionate **PHP Developer** with a strong background in backend development and a curious mind for experimenting with new technologies.  

Alongside PHP & Laravel, I also work with **Python**, **MS Dynamics NAV**, **C#**, and occasionally dive into **Arduino** for fun hardware projects.  

✨ What drives me:  
- Turning ideas into working software  
- Automating boring stuff  
- Writing code that makes future-me (and other devs) happy  
- Exploring how different technologies can work together  

🌍 You can usually find me tinkering with:  
- **Web applications** (Laravel, Flask, Vue/React experiments)  
- **System integrations** (ERP, APIs, data flows)  
- **Electronics + software mashups** (Arduino projects)

💡 Fun fact: I enjoy mixing **serious enterprise code** with **geeky experiments**, because programming should be both **useful** and **fun**.
